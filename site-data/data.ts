      'The guys at Pro Best Carpentry removed an old rotting sunroom and turned it into a covered porch. I can’t say enough about these guys. Very professional and good at their jobs. They were beyond thorough every step of the way and always made sure everything was how we wanted it. I’d would recommend them to anyone needing any work done.',

      "Tom does great work,  but for many of these projects he wasn't the designer or did he do the critical measurements. A talented young man who, as far as I know,  has little design training. People should be aware of this if they are contemplating a complicated design.",
